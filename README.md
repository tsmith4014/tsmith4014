## <h2 align="center">🛠️ DevOps Practices in Action 🛠️ [![Update README](https://github.com/tsmith4014/tsmith4014/actions/workflows/update_readme.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tsmith4014/tsmith4014/actions/workflows/update_readme.yml)</h2>

I've implemented a multi-faceted CI/CD pipeline right here in my GitHub profile! Every day at 1AM and 1PM EST, GitHub Actions trigger a YAML configuration file. This file sets up an Ubuntu environment, installs Python, and resolves dependencies. It then runs two Python scripts: one fetches a new programming joke from JokeAPI and the other fetches a new activity suggestion from BoredAPI. Both updates are then reflected in this README.md, providing not only a fresh laugh but also a novel suggestion for something interesting to do every day. This showcases the power and flexibility of DevOps practices in real-time, making my profile more engaging and dynamic.

⚡ AI Joke of the Day: 🤖 Judge: "I sentence you to the maximum punishment..."
Me (thinking): "Please be death, please be death..."
Judge: "Learn Java!"
Me: "Damn." 🤖

⚡ AI Suggestion of the Day: 🤖 👥 Be social | 👫 Grab a couple friends | 💰 It's free! | 👌 Super easy to do | 🎉 Compliment someone 🤖

---

<h4 align="center">Automation Configuration</h4>
The entire process is automated using a `.yml` configuration file that resides in the `.github/workflows` directory of this repository. This YAML file defines the GitHub Action, specifying when it should run, what script it should execute, and other settings to ensure smooth operation.
<h4 align="center">Use of Secrets and Environment Variables</h4>
To keep sensitive information secure, I use GitHub Secrets to store API keys and other confidential data. These secrets are then mapped to environment variables within the `.yml` file, ensuring they are securely passed to the running script without being exposed.
<h4 align="center">GitHub Actions</h4>
The GitHub Action is configured to use a specific runner environment, install necessary dependencies, and execute the Python script. It also sets up caching and error-handling mechanisms to optimize the workflow.

<h4 align="center">Suggestions are fetched from [BoredAPI](https://www.boredapi.com/).</h4>

## <h2 align="center">🎼 Balance in Code and Life 🍃</h2>

Professionally, I am deeply involved in cloud architecture, software development, Statistics, API creation & database management. However, it's not just about balance in code; it's about balance in life! When I'm not engrossed in technology, you can find me at the VA practicing Chi Gong and Tai Chi for mental and physical harmony. The practice involves intricate movements with a traditional Chinese fan, adding an engaging dynamic to the practice while enhancing balance and focus. I also take this balance to the community by volunteering at my local Humane Society, helping our four-legged friends find forever homes 🐱🐶. "I also enjoy using my 🔭telescope🔭 to find celestial objects like 🪐Saturn🪐 and its amazing rings, or watching the tiny specks of 🌕Jupiter's satellites🌕 catching the sun's rays. 🌌🌠"

## <h2 align="center">🌱 I’m currently diving deep into:</h2>

- **AWS Architecture**:
  - Using Terraform to provision AWS resources.
  - Ansible configuration of AWS resources.

  - Utilizing AWS Config for compliance checks and resource tracking.
- **Web Hosting**: Hosting WordPress on public EC2 instances with optional offsite private database Direct Connect functionality.
- **Database Management**: Using private instances for databases, adhering to AWS best practices.
